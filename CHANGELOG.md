# 1.1.0 | 2021-10-18

- New border and background colors (mainly to improve visiblity of GUI settings editor inputs)
- Overhaul git decor colors: 'modified' now blue instead of orange, 'conflicting' now orange instead of blue, used 
duller colors so they don't stand out over primary color of each theme, and added missing ones
- Dulled some blue colors relative to red, green, and orange (since blues tend to look more saturated even in CIELAB)

- Initial release
