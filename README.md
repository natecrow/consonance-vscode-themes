# About

1. **Colors are defined using LCh(ab)**, a cylindrical transformation of CIELAB color space, which was designed to be perceptually uniform and approximate human vision. This ensures the colors are accurate and consistent within and across themes.
2. **Color palettes consist of one primary hue and a secondary hue that complements it.** The primary hue is mostly used for more colorful elements while the complementary hue is mostly used for subdued, neutral elements. This creates a soothing, minimalist aesthetic while still adding a bit of color contrast between colorful and neutral elements.
3. **Relies on lightness + chroma and bold + italic text over color to provide contrast.** This adds contrast while still allowing for a limited color palette. Lightness and chroma values were carefully tweaked to try to provide high enough contrast between elements without overdoing it.
